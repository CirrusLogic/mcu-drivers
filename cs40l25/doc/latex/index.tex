This document outlines the driver source code included in the M\+CU Driver Software Package for the C\+S40\+L25 Boosted Haptics Driver. This guide is primarily intended for those involved in end-\/system implementation, integration, and testing, who will use the C\+S40\+L25 M\+CU Driver Software Package to integrate the C\+S40\+L25 driver source code into the end-\/system\textquotesingle{}s host M\+CU software. After reviewing this guide, the reader will be able to begin software integration of the C\+S40\+L25 M\+CU driver and then have the ability to initialize, reset, boot, configure, and service events from the C\+S40\+L25. This guide should be used along with the C\+S40\+L25 Datasheet.
